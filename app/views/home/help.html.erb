        <div class="q-a-heading">Sherlock Docs - Help &amp; Support</div>
        <div class="answer-part">Before attempting to use SherlockDocs make 
          sure you have the following applications installed on your computer 
          - both are free:
          <br />
          <a target="_blank" href="http://java.com/en/download/index.jsp">http://java.com/en/download/index.jsp</a><br />

          <br />
          SherlockDocs is based on a block building approach. You chose the 
          type of block you wish to create from a drop down menu, click insert 
          and the new block will appear. You can edit the blocks after creation, 
          delete the blocks, insert new blocks in between old blocks. <br />
          <br />
          <em>Note about Java - for a long time Oracle didn't uninstall older 
          versions of Java when you upgraded to a newer version. If you are 
          having trouble with the screencapture or screencaster its possible 
          that you have multiple older versions of Java installed on your 
          computer. Click on your Control Panel, Add/Remove Programs and 
          uninstall any older versions of Java. The good news is that once 
          you remove older versions now Oracle overwrites older versions of 
          Java when you download a new one.</em><br />

        <div class="question-part">How do I get my company name to appear on my Cases Home Page?</div>

        <div class="question-part">How large a file can I upload?</div>
        <div class="answer-part">Remember that you have storage limits based on your plan. However, bear in mind that upload speeds are very slow compared to download speed. We recommend that you keep uploaded files below 50 MB.  Better yet, use the video screencast option to keep file sizes minimized for your clients. If you want to send clients large video files with gigabytes of data, the best option is to burn it to a DVD.  </div>
        <div class="question-part">How to I use a text block?</div>
        <div class="answer-part">Just start typing - a scroll block will appear if the text in your block exceeds the visual screen space. There are lots of tools along the bottom of the text block to help format the text - bullet points, alignment icons.</div>

Once you enter it and click OK then a success button will appear. Once done you will return to the case screen and can continue.

          <ul style="margin: 0 0 1em 1em;">

            <li> limits on file size that most email providers have
