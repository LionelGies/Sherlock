Dear <%= @user.first_name %>,
    
We hope you found that SherlockDocs met your report writing needs. Your free trial period has expired. Please go to http://www.sherlockdocs/pricing and chose your plan now.

Now, you could create the same type of reports using MS Word($280), Adobe Adobe Acrobat X Suite ($800), Pinnacle Studio ($60) and Camtasia Studio ($300), but why spend that type of money? And our secure client share function could be duplicated with a web portal, but that would cost your thousands of dollars to set up.

In this age where the use of images, video and credible authority directly from a source is required, a tool like SherlockDocs is indispensable for communicating results with your clients.  And with pricing starting at just $9/month it is a fraction of the cost involved in doing your investigation - why not guarantee that your clients will receive a report that maximizes the impact of your research?

Head on over to http://www.sherlockdocs/pricing and chose your plan now.
